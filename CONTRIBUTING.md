# Contributing to KeyDrive

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to KeyDrive! The main ways you can help is by reporting (or responding to) [issues], creating [pull requests], and participating in [discussions].

## Reporting an Issue

- Check if your issue is already reported by using the search tool. If so, please provide feedback or react to that issue instead of opening a new one.
- If applicable, attach screenshots to help clarify the problem.
- Mention the KeyDrive version you are using, the operating system it is running on, and the browser you are using.

## Creating a Pull Request

- Open your pull request against the `main` branch.
- It should pass all CI checks: passing all tests and the SonarCloud quality gate. This also means adding new (and/or modifying existing) tests to cover your proposed changes.

## Discussions

This is the place for all other community interaction! Here you can discuss ideas for features, ask for help, and everything else that doesn't fit in an issue.
